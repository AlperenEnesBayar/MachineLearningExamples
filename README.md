# MachineLearningExamples for myself

Some of them written in Jupiter Notebook and others in PyCharm IDE.

It contains some basic Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks. But mostly Deep Q Learnig (just Q Learningsometimes) projects. (Generally, Gym Library used)

* TitanicML.ipynb - Basic HelloWorld project to learn what's the Neural Networks. Titanic Dataset used.
* ClassificationML.ipynb - Basic Classification project with iris plant dataset.
* ClusteringML.ipynb - Again basic project to learn Hidden Markov Model and Tensorflow basics
* gymExamplesTaxi.ipynb - First Q Learning project with Taxi Game
* gymExamplesFrozenLake.ipynb - A little complex environmental. Q Learning Game.
* gymExamplesCartPole.py - First Deep Q Learning project with an Cart Pole Game
